# Face-Emotion-Recognition
It is Artificial Intelligence Project using machine learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm model.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recognize various face emotions using machine learning models. The model has been trained on six different categories of your emotions:

- Happy
- Disgust
- Angry
- Normal
- surprised
- yawning

By running project you can analyze your face emotions.

## Why use CNN Model?
  
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is specifically designed to work with image data. CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. The key feature of CNNs is their ability to extract spatial features from images using convolutional filters. These filters are learned during the training process and allow the CNN to identify patterns and features in the image data.
